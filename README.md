Made with AFRAME webVR, a great way to create 3d environments viewable in both  a browser window and VR headset. Scripting was done with THREE.js, vanilla JavaScript, and node via express. This is still a work in progress, specifically UI elements and 3D models, but the app is functional as a working prototype.
